<h1> Project 77 </h1>
<p>Today we will learn how to setup and use visual studio. As we have used brackets, we will use visual studio th
    same way, but visual studio is a lot more advanced than brackets. Visual studio has many extensions and libraries that will help us learn javascript in a much better way. Also we will learn concepts of console in javascrip
    All computer languages in the world are very similar to english so that we humans can understand the code and can write code. These are called High Level Languages since they are understood by humans But Computers work on 0s and 1s which is called binary or machine level language since this language is understood by machines. So every language has an internal translator which converts the code you write into 0s and 1s. This is called a compile
    complier
    So when you press the Run button to run your code, the compiler translates your code into machine language and that is how the computer can execute your code. So a compiler is an internal software which converts high level programming language (readable by humans) to low level language (readable by machine).
    Also today we are going to Use another IDE that is Integrated Development Environment. It is a software which will help us write advanced and complex code.
    We have been using Brackets but brackets is limited for creating websites etc. only. Now we will be learning to write advanced code where we will build more complex games and apps. So for that we are going to use an IDE called Visual Studio Code. This IDE is created by Microsoft which also develops windows operating systems.

<p>Console is a screen where you display your output, and it is used for testing purposes. Before printing anything on the HTML page it is advisable to print on the console screen. </p>
<h1>Open console screen</h1>
<script>
    console.log( "My first console project");
    var first_name="Surya";
    console.log(first_name);
    var last_name="Garg";
    console.log(last_name);
    var full_name=first_name.concat(last_name);
    console.log(full_name);
    var num1= 12;
    var num2= 15;
    console.log(num1 + num2);
    console.log(num1 - num2);
    console.log(num1 * num2);
    console.log(num1 / num2);
